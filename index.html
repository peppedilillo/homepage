<p>
    Hey, welcome to my homepage, and thanks for the visit.
    My name is Giuseppe Dilillo, but everyone calls me Peppe.
    I’m 35 years old, originally from Barletta, and currently living in Frascati, near Rome.
    In this space I share my projects, studies and whatever else I’m currently interested in.
</p>

<p>
    You can reach me at <a href="mailto:giuseppe.dilillo@inaf.it" class="email">giuseppe.dilillo@inaf.it</a> or <a
        href="mailto:peppedilillo@gmail.com" class="email">peppedilillo@gmail.com</a>.
    I publish much of my code on <a href="https://github.com/peppedilillo">GitHub</a>, including both work projects and projects I get into for curiosity’s sake.
    I also have a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/giuseppe-dilillo-9b9025207/">LinkedIn</a> I never check.
    Hope you enjoy the stay and maybe find something useful here. Take care!

<h2>Work</h2>

<p>
    I am an astrophysicist and experimental physicist with an interest for computer science and applied math.
    Currently, I work for the Italian National Institute for Astrophysics, at the Italian Space Agency Space Science
    Data Centre.
    There, I mainly deal with data and software supporting high-energy space missions.
    In the past I spent a lot of my time in labs, where I worked with high-energy, solid-state detectors and
    nanosatellites.<br>
    A complete list of my articles is available on
    <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/search/p_=0&q=author%3A%22Dilillo%2C%20Giuseppe%22&sort=date%20desc%2C%20bibcode%20desc">NASA/ADS</a>

    I love music, and sometime play the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wlpnc5EMvM4">bass</a>.
    I also like movies and good reads.
    For the past few years I have been keeping a <a href="ybests.html">list</a> of interesting things I come through.
    They are organized per year, five max per section and updated whenever.
